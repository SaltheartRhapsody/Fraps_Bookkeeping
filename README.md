Fraps_Bookkeeping
=================

Simple autoit bookkeeping script I threw together last month to keep better track of my fraps recordings.
It's basically a watchdog that indexes/renames files according to timestamps, in a way that plays well
with virtualdub (which I use for editing).  It's written in autoit, a general purpose scripting language
used commonly for automation in a windows environment.
